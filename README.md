# fmdl
FloMarching downloader script. No account needed.

## Requirements
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

## Usage
`./fmdl.sh <FloMarching video URL> <output file>`

### Note:
This script only works with relatively recent FloMarching videos. Older videos can usually be downloaded directly with `yt-dlp`, and the script will prompt you to do that if it detects you tried to download an older video.
